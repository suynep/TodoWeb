# TODO

- Persist the database --> I agree on one thing: The design for this website isn't `logical`. Logical in the sense that the design isn't adequate for what I'm planning to do. 
I should've first implemented a database, put the form data into the database, then fetch from the database to display the todos. But this can be changed via a small tweak in the present design in and of itself. How?
